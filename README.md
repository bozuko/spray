## Description
load.js is a load testing tool designed for HTTP testing. It allows for easy testing of RESTful APIs and provides useful statistics. load.js integrates with [cube](https://github.com/square/cube) to provide realtime graphs of the running load test. To use multiple cores, just run the same test in parallel. Cube can handle the aggregation.
